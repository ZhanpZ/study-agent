**Task:** Added micro-interactions across the frontend to improve attention span and engagement.

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/index.css` — Added 10 new CSS keyframe animations (message-enter, phase-pulse, phase-shimmer, btn-interactive, btn-ripple, score-glow, option-select, shake, bounce-correct)
- `frontend/src/components/MessageBubble.jsx` — Word-by-word typewriter reveal for new agent messages + slide-up entrance animation
- `frontend/src/components/Chat.jsx` — Score count-up animation + glow pulse, improved smooth scroll, button press/ripple effects, phase transition shimmer
- `frontend/src/components/PhaseIndicator.jsx` — Pulse/glow animation on phase circle during transitions
- `frontend/src/components/MCQPanel.jsx` — Option selection bounce animation, submit button press effect, panel entrance animation
- `frontend/src/components/ComprehensionPanel.jsx` — Bounce animation on correct answers, shake on wrong answers
- `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.js` — Added `isNew` flag to WebSocket messages to distinguish live vs restored messages

**Context:** The app displayed content instantly with minimal motion. Adding micro-interactions (typewriter streaming, button feedback, phase pulse, score animations, MCQ selection/reveal effects) keeps the user's attention engaged during study sessions. All animations are pure CSS + minimal React state — no external libraries added.
